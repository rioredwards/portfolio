# Code Quality Standards

- USE THE LATEST VERSIONS OF THE LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS BEING USED!

Any code you write should be:
- contextually relevant to the libraries and frameworks being used and inline with the project's general purpose.
- consistent with the project's coding style and conventions.
- make use of existing code and components when it makes sense to do so.
- maintainable and easy to understand.
- optimized for the web and mobile devices.
