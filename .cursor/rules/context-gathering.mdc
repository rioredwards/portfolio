# Context Gathering

## Gather Relevant Context from the project files before making changes

- Look look at all the components, the README.md, and the packages.json file for this repo to get all the relevant context. Note the libraries being used (Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, etc.).

## Gather relevant context from other sources

- Use the mcps and/or internet search to gather relevant context from other sources that is not already available in the project files.
