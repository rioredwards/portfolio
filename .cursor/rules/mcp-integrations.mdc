# MCP Integrations

- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
- Use the GitKraken MCP for git-related tasks.
- Use the Shadcn MCP when you are using the shadcn/ui library or components.
- Use the Chrome DevTools MCP for browser/ui/web-frontend-related tasks.
- Use the Next.js DevTools MCP for Next.js-related tasks (this whole project is built with Next.js, so this will be used frequently).
