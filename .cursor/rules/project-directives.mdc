# Project Directives

- Don't overcomplicate or overengineer things. This project IS NOT AN ENTERPRISE-LEVEL PROJECT! It's a personal portfolio website.

- When in doubt, ask me for clarification.

- Don't make sweeping changes to the codebase without asking me for confirmation first. Try to keep the changes small and focused.
