# Complete Next Task:

## General directives
- Complete the next task in the TODO list in the README.md file unless a specific task is specified. If so, follow the instructions for that task.
- By default, skip any tasks that are not top priority (marked with ❤️).

- Don't skip ahead and complete more tasks than I aks for at once.

If I intend for you to complete a specific task, it will be presented here:
