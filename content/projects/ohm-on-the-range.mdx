I built the official website for **Ohm on the Range**, a music, art, and wellness festival at the base of Mount Adams. I owned the whole thing: brand identity, logo, design system, frontend, content architecture, and launch.

---

## What it is

A fast festival site where attendees, volunteers, artists, and vendors find what they need quickly and buy tickets. Eventbrite handles ticketing, Google Forms handles applications. Everything else is custom.

---

## Goals and constraints

This site had to do two jobs at once: capture the festival's whimsical "space-cowboy" energy, and still function as a practical tool people rely on. Most visitors arrive on mobile from social (often on weak connections), looking for one answer fast, and the details change leading up to the event and year-to-year. That drove a few clear build priorities:

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Constraint", "Response"],
    rows: [
      [
        "Mobile-first traffic + weak connections",
        "SSR, optimized images with mobile/desktop crops, progressive enhancement, near-perfect Lighthouse.",
      ],
      [
        "Accessibility is non-negotiable",
        "Screen-reader content generated from the same data source as the UI, semantic headings, touch-friendly targets.",
      ],
      [
        "Time-sensitive info changes often",
        "Single data source feeds UI, screen-reader layer, and JSON-LD. Modular card-based homepage makes adding lineups, announcements, or links painless.",
      ],
      [
        "People want essentials immediately",
        "Easy navigation, information architecture built around what people actually came for: dates, tickets, lineup, FAQs.",
      ],
    ],
  }}
/>

## Highlights

### Visual storytelling

The festival has a great photo archive, so I leaned into that. Photography does the heavy lifting: scenery shots, lasers, crowd energy and candid moments.

The hero uses a rotating full-bleed carousel:

- selective mobile/desktop crops to preserve framing
- preloads the next image
- smooth crossfades for a cinematic feel

  caption="Hero carousel (preloaded + crossfade transitions)"
  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

### Background effects as progressive enhancement

I added a geometric particle background (particles.js), and treated it as _progressive enhancement_. It loads after first paint, so the actual content is always there first. The particles are just atmosphere; if they don't load, nothing breaks.

<LightboxVideo
  src="/work/images/ohm/ohm-particle-background.mp4"
  caption="Particle background effect (loaded without blocking core content)"
  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

### Custom UI that works everywhere

The "Get Involved" page uses these custom 3D flip cards (inspired by a component on Linktree's site). They use CSS 3D transforms and detect pointer type: on desktop they flip on hover, on mobile they flip on tap. I've reused this pattern on other projects since. Fancy hover effects are great, but they have to work on touch devices too.

## Content architecture: one source, three outputs

One system I'm especially proud of: lineup content is defined once and transformed into three outputs which together boost the site's SEO and accessibility.

The data is stored as typesafe, structured data (JSON+LD). The object contains dates, locations, organizer info, and performer lists all in one place. From that single source, I generate:

- `RenderableLineupItem` (UI): the visual content (titles + images)
- `ScreenReadableLineupItem` (a11y): human-readable strings rendered with sr-only so screen readers announce meaningful text instead of raw data.
- `StructuredDataForLineupItem` (SEO): JSON-LD embedded via `<script>` tags for rich results.

Because it's fully type-safe, adding the next year's lineup is straightforward: update one file, and the poster image, screen-reader output, and structured data all update together.

Note: the repo is private, but I put some code snippets at the bottom of this page if you're curious.

## Process and collaboration

I kicked off the project with requirements gathering and design exploration in Figma, then ran feedback rounds with the Ohm on the Range team to align on brand and content priorities.

We did four formal review rounds with mockups shared in Figma and a shared Google Doc for lightweight project tracking. Things really clicked when I got the team to sit with me in a live Figma session—watching me work while describing what they wanted in real time.

  caption="Early mockups and review rounds in Figma"

### Branding and design system

I developed a design system aligned to the festival's identity: fonts, colors, and reusable tokens. Designs started in Figma and were implemented with CSS variables to keep the codebase consistent and easy to iterate on. I also created the festival logo and supporting brand assets.

## Results

First month after launch: **3,000+ unique visitors**, more than double the previous year's traffic. Lighthouse scores are near-perfect across every route, which matters when half your audience is on a phone with spotty festival-area cell service.

## Final thoughts

I'm proud of how this project came together. The content pipeline, the accessibility layer, the performance work, the brand system. It all clicked, the client was happy, and the numbers backed it up.

## Code snippets (for the nerds)

Here's the lineup content pipeline at a high level:
