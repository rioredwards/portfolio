I built the official website for **Ohm on the Range**, a music, art, and wellness festival held each year at the base of Mount Adams.

---

## Project snapshot

**What it is:** A fast, mobile-first festival site where attendees, volunteers, artists, and vendors can quickly find key info—and buy tickets.

**What I did:** Led an end-to-end redesign: requirements, brand + design system, implementation, and launch polish.

### Tech stack

- **Next.js** & **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **shadcn/ui** & **Radix UI**
- **particles.js**

## Goals and constraints

The site needed to capture the festival's fun, space-cowboy energy—think neon desert + cosmic vibes—while staying fast, accessible, and mobile-first.

Most visitors arrive from social posts or word-of-mouth while they're out with friends, not sitting at a laptop. That shaped the UX: clear content hierarchy, thumb-friendly tap targets, skimmable layout, and performance tuned for mobile.

## Highlights

### Visual storytelling

The festival is visually stunning, so photography became the centerpiece. I had access to a large media archive and curated a set that tells the story at a glance: daytime scenery, nighttime stage/laser production, and lots of crowd moments (because the social side of a festival is the experience).

The hero fills the viewport with a rotating carousel of full-bleed images. To keep framing consistent, I made separate crops for mobile and desktop on select shots.

Under the hood, the carousel preloads the next image and crossfades between them for a smooth, cinematic feel. I prototyped the transition in a small HTML/CSS sandbox, then translated it into the site.

  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

### Background effects as progressive enhancement

I built a geometric particle background with particles.js and treated it as progressive enhancement—loaded so it never blocks primary content. First paint stays focused on what users came for (lineup, tickets, info), and the effect layers in once the page is usable.

  caption="Particle background effect"
  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

### Playful 3D flip cards

On the “Get Involved” page, I designed and built 3D flip-cards inspired by an element on Linktree's site. They're implemented with CSS 3D transforms and work cleanly across mobile and desktop using Tailwind's `pointer-coarse` / `pointer-fine` pseudo-classes.

  className="w-full rounded-lg"
/>

### Single-source-of-truth for content

One system I'm especially proud of: lineup content is defined once and transformed into three outputs which together boost the site's SEO and accessibility.

The data is stored as typesafe, structured data (JSON+LD). The object contains dates, locations, organizer info, and performer lists all in one place. From that single source, I generate:

- `RenderableLineupItem` (UI): the visual content (titles + images)
- `ScreenReadableLineupItem` (a11y): human-readable strings rendered with sr-only, so screen readers announce meaningful text instead of raw data.
- `StructuredDataForLineupItem` (SEO): JSON-LD embedded via `<script>` tags for rich results.

Because it's fully type-safe, adding the next year's lineup is straightforward: update one file, and the poster image, screen-reader output, and structured data all update together.

> **Note:** the repo is private, but I put some code snippets at the bottom of this page if you're curious.

## Process and collaboration

I kicked off the project with requirements gathering and design exploration in Figma, then ran feedback rounds with the Ohm on the Range team to align on brand and content priorities.

We did four formal review rounds with mockups shared in Figma and a shared Google Doc for lightweight project tracking. Things really clicked when I got the team to sit with me in a live Figma session—watching me work while describing what they wanted in real time.

  caption="Early mockups + review rounds with the Ohm on the Range team."
/>

### Branding and design system

I developed a design system aligned to the festival's identity: fonts, colors, and reusable tokens. Designs started in Figma and were implemented with CSS variables to keep the codebase consistent and easy to iterate on. I also created the festival logo and supporting brand assets.

## Results

Within the first month of launch, the site reached 3,000+ unique visitors which was more than double the previous year's traffic.

Because the site is content-heavy in the places that matter (lineup, FAQs), performance was a feature—not an afterthought. I targeted strong Lighthouse scores and a snappy feel across routes.

Tickets are purchased through an Eventbrite embed, and applications link out to Google Forms.

## Final thoughts

This project reinforced that “simple” can still be deeply professional: a static build, carefully structured content, and strong UX fundamentals backed by real engineering decisions. The result is a site that communicates clearly, looks like the festival feels, and works seamlessly across devices.

## Code snippets (for the nerds)

Here's how I structured the lineup content:
